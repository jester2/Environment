# Environment
config files for my bash environment

So, every time I move computers, I have to edit my .vimrc, .bashrc, and other dot files that need configuring.

Keeping my dot files in github allows me to transfer my settings over relatively easy.

You could make a script that simplifies the install process but I chose not to use it yet until I come up with a better process.
